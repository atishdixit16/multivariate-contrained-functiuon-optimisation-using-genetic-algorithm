# multivariate-contrained-functiuon-optimisation-using-genetic-algorithm
R code for stochastic optimisation for multivariate contrained function using genetic algorithm
real number array was used as a genome instance in GA.
Constraints were handled using lagrange multiplier (user operated parameter).
